# GEOWAVE ADMIN CONSOLE

## About
Geowave Admin Console is a web application, primarily using TypeScript and AngularJS, that utilizes the [Geowave](https://github.com/locationtech/geowave) services.

The goal of this project is the lower the barrier of entry and move users away from the command line.


## Getting Started
On your computer, install the Angular CLI in your local project by running.

    npm install @angular/cli

Launch the server by running

    ng serve --open

If necessary, open `localhost:4200` on your browser

## Trouble Shooting
The project is running with node.js v10.16.3 and npm v6.9.0. 

If  `ng serve --open` fails with `command not found: ng`, run `npm link @angular/cli` to link npm to ng.
